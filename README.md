# A-Research-into-World-University-Rankings-and-Ranking-Improvement-DS-Assignment
Many universities, particularly those in developing countries, struggle to improve their global rankings despite efforts in areas like research and citations. This is largely because they lack data-driven insights into which investments will genuinely impact their standings, leading to inefficient resource allocation. This is where we come in. 

“KuduResearch” is a global organization that annually collects data from universities worldwide to understand how they can improve their global standings. They're concerned that universities might be investing in improvement initiatives without knowing which ones actually impact their rankings. As representative of the company, and as data science consultants, we were hired to investigate this.

" How can mid and lower-tier universities effectively identify and prioritize specific investments that are most predictive of improving their global rank tier whilst avoiding inefficient resource allocation? " 

What are the four questions we will investigate in our assignment? 
1. "What are the global trends in university rankings across continents?"
2. "Why do universities from certain regions consistently rank lower than others despite high research, and citation performance?”
3. “Can we classify universities into rank tier (e.g., Top 200, Mid 400, bottom) based on their Quality of Education, Alumni Employment, Quality of Faculty, and World Rank?”
4. "What areas should a mid-ranked university invest in to improve its global ranking most effectively?"
